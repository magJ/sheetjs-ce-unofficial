# Redistribution of SheetJS Community Edition 

For unspecified reasons, the SheetJS project decided to stop publishing updates to the `xlsx` npm package.  

They also decided to move the project away from thier old github repo(https://github.com/SheetJS/sheetjs) 
to a self-hosted repo (https://git.sheetjs.com/sheetjs/sheetjs/)

This project simply publishes the latest SheetJS Community Edition to the npm registry, without any modification*


<sub>* The only modification is to the `package.json` to adjust the package name and repo.</sub>


# Issues
Please only report issues related to the publishing process here.   
For issues with the actual library, please report them to the [SheetJS Community Edition](https://git.sheetjs.com/sheetjs/sheetjs/issues) repo.
